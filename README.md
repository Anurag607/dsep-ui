# Installation Steps :walking:

## 1. Fork it :fork_and_knife:

You can get your own fork/copy of [DSEP-UI](https://github.com/Samagra-Development/dsep-ui) by using the <kbd><b>Fork</b></kbd> button.

## 2. Clone it :busts_in_silhouette:

You need to clone (download) it to a local machine using

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Your_Username/dsep-ui.git
```

> This makes a local copy of the repository in your machine.

Once you have cloned the `DSEP-UI` repository in GitHub, move to that folder first using the change directory command.

```sh
# This will change directory to a folder dsep-ui
cd dsep-ui
```

Move to this folder for all other commands.

## 3. Set it up :arrow_up:

Run the following commands to see that _your local copy_ has a reference to _your forked remote repository_ in GitHub :octocat:

```sh
git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/Your_Username/dsep-ui.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/Your_Username/dsep-ui.git (push)
```

Now, add a reference to the original [DSEP-UI](https://github.com/Samagra-Development/dsep-ui) repository using

```sh
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Samagra-Development/dsep-ui.git
```

> This adds a new remote named **_upstream_**.

See the changes using

```sh
git remote -v
origin    https://github.com/Your_Username/dsep-ui.git (fetch)
origin    https://github.com/Your_Username/dsep-ui.git (push)
